# An hyperbolic 203mm f/3.5 mirror

Here are files about the making of an hyperbolic (conic -1.32) mirror tuned for the Baader MPCC coma corrector.

I started by buying a mirror advertised as a 203mm f/4 mirror. You can see in the `base mirror (ouch)` directory that I was in for a surprise ! It was a very, very bad f/5 mirror.

The `grinding` directory shows the tool and end spherometer measurement before polishing.

The `polishing` directory has pictures of my lap and trimming method. I pushed the mirror for ~6h30 before reaching a good spherical polish to the edge. It's plate glass.

The `references` directory has reference pictures of ronchis for a 203mm mirror corrected for various f/ratios. I'm aiming for this before resorting to interferometry.

The `sessions` directory contains a picture of my figuring lap(s) and inside/outside ronchis for each sessions. Still a lot of work to do !

Pictures are worth a lot of words :
